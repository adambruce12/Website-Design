            <h2>Code</h2>
            <img src="../images/el-code.png" alt="Image of source code.">
            <p>Envy Labs seems to largely be structured upon the CSS grid system. They make good use of HTML markup to provide 
               context about their content with different categories used on their site including a header, footer, main, and 
               navigation.</p>
            <h2>User Interface - UI</h2>
            <img src="../images/el-ui.png" alt="Screenshot of user interface.">
            <p>The UI for Envy Labs is visually appealing and implements a variety of design techniques. Content is broken down in a 
                way that makes logical sense and is grouped by related content. One aspect of the user interface that I thought could
                be improved however is the heading on the pages. Sometimes the heading design takes up the full-width and other times 
                it takes up partial width (Insights) or isn’t present at all (Contact). Consistency across pages would help with 
                branding and give the site a similar feel no matter what part a user is on.</p>
            <h2>User Experience - UX</h2>
            <img src="../images/el-ux.png" alt="Screenshot of user interface.">
            <p>Envy Labs provides a user experience that is easy to use, and the site is laid out in a way that is easy to understand 
                immediately to the user.  Having relevant case studies included on content explaining what Envy Labs does provides a 
                quick and simple way for users to access real-world examples of what Envy Labs has to offer, adding a layer of 
                simplicity to the experience. The Insights page provides an intuitive filtering menu based upon category. One way 
                user experience could be improved is by providing real-time validation on the contact us page.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Envy Labs is a visually appealing, user-friendly site that implements a lot of strong design principles. Their code is 
                written to be search engine friendly and provides meaningful context relating to their content. The few drawbacks to 
                their design don’t necessarily take anything away from the website, simply would be additive to what is already a 
                well-developed site.</p>
