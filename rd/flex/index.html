        <p>Flexbox Froggy is an online game that teaches the concepts of flex via helping frogs get to their lilypads. To get the 
        frogs to their lilypads successfully the player must use different flex properties and values to move the frogs.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet/">Free Code Camp: Flexbox-The Ultimate CSS Flex Cheatsheet</a></h2>
        <p>Free Code Camp's Flexbox - The Ultimate CSS Flex Cheatsheet is a comprehensive flexbox cheatsheet that covers terminology and 
        properties with the aid of animated gifs to demonstrate what is happening. The article also links to four games (one being Flexbox

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>There are no shortage of great resources for learning CSS Flex, but the ones listed above are three that I have found personally
        helpful to learn the concepts and also utilize as quick references. Flexbox Froggy adds an element of fun and both the Free Code
        Camp and CSS-Tricks articles provide great illustrations and make great reference guides.</p>
