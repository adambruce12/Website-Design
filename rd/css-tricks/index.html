        <h2><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/">Selectors and Properties</a></h2>
        <p>Selectors provide a way to select elements for styling. Properties are used in CSS to style elements.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/active/">Active </a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/m/marker/">Marker</a> Selectors</h2>
        <p>The :active selector is a pseudo-selector that can be used to change the way a link is displayed while it is
        being activated. The selector is primarily used to provide a visual cue that something has been clicked on and is typically used
        on anchor links; however, the selector can be applied to any element.</p>
        <p>The ::marker selector is a pseudo-element that is used for styling the marker of a list element. Combined with the content
        property, the ::marker selector can be used to change what a marker is, or can also be used on its own to change the color of a 
        marker. The ::marker selector can be used on any element by changing the element's display property to "list-item".</p>
        <h2><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/q/quotes/">Quotes</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/v/vertical-align/">Vertical Align Properties</a></h2>
        <p>Quotes enables specifity over which types of quotes are used when added through content: open-quote or content: close-quote
        rules. The four values that are available for the property are open-quote, close-quote, no-open-quote, and no-close quote.
        There can be as many pairs of quotes in the quotes property as needed, however, there is no need for more than two due to
        the property repeating the quote values from the beginning.</p>
        <p>The vertical-align property sets how elements display next to each other on a line. For the property to work there must be a 
        baseline set for elements, such as inline or in-line block. Values for vertical-align include: baseline, top, bottom, middle,
        text-top, text-bottom, sub, super, and length. Full list and descriptions of each value can be found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/v/vertical-align/">here.</a>
        </p>
