        <h2>src and srcset</h2>
        <p>The src and srcset attributes are used to provide different sized versions of an image. This allows the browser to choose
        which version to use based on a multitude of factors. The src attribute gets assigned like normal, but the srcset attribute
        can take an additional parameter such as 2x, letting the browser know to use that image if being displayed on a higher 
        pixel-density display. The src and srcset attributes can be combined under the srcset attribute, using a comma to separate
        values. More info can be found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#using-srcset">
        here.</a></p>
        <h2>Sizes</h2>
        <p>The sizes attribute sets the width an image will be display within the layout of a site. This means that image width is
        both layout and viewport dependent. The sizes attribute can be used to set the width of an image across multiple breakpoints, with
        values being separated by a comma. </p>
        <h2>Art Direction</h2>
        <p>Art Direction is a technique that utilizes media queries and multiple versions of the same image, all sized differently,
        to change the image being displayed based on breakpoints. It is commonly used as a way to crop and zoom images but it can
        also be used to create images for users in dark mode, avoid sending GIFS to users that prefer reduced motion, set a maximum 
        resolution cap, or send static, high-res, monochrome images to printers and e-ink devices.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Art direction, sizes, and the src and srcset attributes provide meaningful ways to use the appropriate image at the appropriate
        time. Knowing what syntax to use and when to use allows web developers to be offering the best UI while also making choices that
        offer the best UX for users. </p>
